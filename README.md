### What is a virtual machine?

A vitual machine is the emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architecture and provides the functionality of a physical machine. It creates a virtualized environment that can run an operating system and execute software applications as if they were running on a physical computer. Virtual machines allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical computer.

### What is a development enviroment?

A set of tools, software, and configurations used by developers to create, test, and debug software applications. It usually includes programming languages, integrated development environments (IDEs), text editors, version control systems, testing frameworks, and other tools that help developers to write, test, and deploy code. 

### What is the purpose of the dev env?

It provide a separate and controlled environment for software developers to write, test, and debug their code without affecting the production environment.  It also enables them to catch and fix errors and bugs before they make it to the production environment.
